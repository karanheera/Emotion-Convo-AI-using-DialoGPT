## How to Contribute

### 1. **Fork the Repository**
   First, create a fork of the repository by clicking on the "Fork" button at the top-right corner of the repository page. This creates a personal copy of the project under your GitHub account.

### 2. **Clone the Repository**
   After forking the repository, clone it to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/[repository-name].git
   ```

### 3. **Create a New Branch**
   Always create a new branch for your changes. This helps to keep the `main` branch clean and makes it easier to review your work.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-name
   ```

### 4. **Make Changes**
   Make the necessary changes to the project. You can add new features, fix bugs, improve documentation, etc. Be sure to test your changes locally to ensure they work as expected.

### 5. **Commit Your Changes**
   Once you’ve made your changes, commit them with a descriptive message. Use clear, concise commit messages that explain what you’ve done.
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add a brief description of the changes"
   ```

### 6. **Push Your Changes**
   Push the changes to your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-name
   ```

### 7. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**
   Go to the original repository (your forked repository) and open a **Pull Request** (PR) against the `main` branch. Provide a clear description of what you have done in the PR message, and explain why the changes are necessary.

## Code Style Guidelines

- **Python Code**: Follow the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide for Python code. Make sure your code is clean, readable, and well-documented.
- **Commit Messages**: Use concise and descriptive commit messages. Each commit should represent a single logical change.
  
  Example commit message:  
  ```
  Fix bug in story generation logic
  ```
  
- **Comments**: Include comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious code.

## Testing

Make sure to test any new features or changes thoroughly. While there is no formal testing setup in this repository, basic functionality can be tested by running the app and verifying that the story generation works as expected.
